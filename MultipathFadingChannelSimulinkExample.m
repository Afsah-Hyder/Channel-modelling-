%% Multipath Fading Channel in Simulink
% This model shows how to use the SISO Fading Channel block from the
% Communications Toolbox(TM) to simulate multipath Rayleigh and Rician
% fading channels, which are useful models of real-world phenomena in
% wireless communications. These phenomena include multipath scattering
% effects, time dispersion, and Doppler shifts that arise from relative
% motion between the transmitter and receiver. The model also shows how to
% visualize channel characteristics such as the impulse and frequency
% responses, Doppler spectrum and component gains.

%% Model and Parameters
% The example model simulates QPSK transmission over a multipath Rayleigh
% fading channel and a multipath Rician fading channel. Both the channel
% blocks are configured from the SISO Fading Channel library block. You can
% control transmission and channel parameters via workspace variables.
modelname     = 'commmultipathfading';
rayleighBlock = [modelname '/Rayleigh Channel'];
%ricianBlock   = [modelname '/Rician Channel'];
rayleighCD    = [modelname '/Rayleigh Constellation Diagram'];
pathGainBlock = [modelname '/Path Gains (dB)'];
open_system(modelname);

%%
% The following variables control the "Bit Source" block. By default, the
% bit rate is 10M b/s (5M sym/s) and each transmitted frame is 2000 bits
% long (1000 symbols).
bitRate  % Transmission rate (b/s)
bitsPerFrame  % Number of bits per frame

%%
% The following variables control both the Rayleigh and Rician fading
% channel blocks. By default, the channels are modeled as four fading
% paths, each representing a cluster of multipath components received at
% around the same delay.
delayVector  % Discrete path delays (s)
gainVector  % Average path gains (dB)

%%
% By convention, the delay of the first path is typically set to zero. For
% subsequent paths, a 1 microsecond delay corresponds to a 300 m difference
% in path length. In some outdoor multipath environments, reflected paths
% can be up to several kilometers longer than the shortest path. With the
% path delays specified above, the last path is 240 m longer than the
% shortest path, and thus arrives 0.8 microseconds later.
%%
% Together, the path delays and average path gains specify the delay
% profile of the channel. Typically, the average path gains decay
% exponentially with delay (i.e., the dB values decay linearly), but the
% specific delay profile depends on the propagation environment. On each
% channel block, we have also turned on the option to normalize the average
% path gains so that their average gain is 0 dB over time.
%%
% The following variable controls the maximum Doppler shift which is
% computed as v*f/c, where v is the mobile speed, f is the carrier
% frequency, and c is the speed of light. The default maximum Doppler shift
% in the model is 200 Hz which corresponds to a mobile speed of 65 mph (30
% m/s) and a carrier frequency of 2 GHz.
maxDopplerShift  % Maximum Doppler shift of diffuse components (Hz)

%%
% The following variables apply to the Rician fading channel block. The
% Doppler shift of the line-of-sight component is typically smaller than
% the maximum Doppler shift, |maxDopplerShift|, and depends on the
% direction of travel of the mobile relative to the direction of the
% line-of-sight path. The K-factor specifies the ratio of average received
% power from the line-of-sight path relative to that of the associated
% diffuse components.
LOSDopplerShift  % Doppler shift of line-of-sight component (Hz)
KFactor  % Ratio of specular power to diffuse power (linear)

%%
% The SISO Fading Channel block can visualize channel impulse response,
% frequency response, and Doppler spectrum while the model is running. To
% invoke it, set the |Channel visualization| parameter to the desired
% channel characteristic(s) before running the model. Note that turning on
% channel visualization may slow down your simulation.
%% Wideband or Frequency-Selective Fading
% By default, the delay span (0.8 microseconds) of the channel is larger
% than the input QPSK symbol period (0.2 microseconds), and causes
% considerable intersymbol interference (ISI). So the resultant channel
% frequency response is not flat and may have deep fades over the 10M Hz
% signal bandwidth. Because the power level varies over the bandwidth, it
% is referred to as frequency-selective fading.
%%
% Setting the |Channel visualization| parameter of the channel block to
% 'Impulse response' shows the bandlimited impulse response (yellow
% circles). The visualization also shows the delays and magnitudes of the
% underlying fading path gains (pink stems) clustered around the peak of
% the impulse response. Note that the path gains do not equal the |Average
% path gains (dB)| parameter value because the Doppler effect causes the
% gains to fluctuate over time.

%%
% As displayed, the channel impulse response coincides with the path gains
% for this delay profile because the discrete path delays are all integer
% multiples of the input symbol period. In this case, there is also no
% channel filter delay.
%%
% Similarly, setting the |Channel visualization| parameter to 'Frequency
% response' shows the frequency response of the channel. You can also set
% |Channel visualization| to 'Impulse and frequency responses' to display
% both impulse and frequency responses side by side. You can see that the
% power level of the channel varies across the whole bandwidth.

set_param(modelname,'SimulationCommand','start');

%%
% As shown in the channel visualization plots, you can also control the
% percentage of the input samples to be visualized by changing the
% |Percentage of samples  to display| parameter of the channel block. In
% general, the smaller the percentage, the faster the model runs. Once the
% visualization figure opens, click the |Playback| button and turn off the
% |Reduce Updates to Improve Performance| or |Reduce Plot Rate to Improve
% Performance| option to further improve display accuracy. The option is on
% by default for faster simulation. To see the channel response for every
% input sample, uncheck this option and set |Percentage of samples to
% display| to '100%'.
%%
% For the same channel specification, we now display the Doppler spectrum
% for its first discrete path, which is a statistical characterization of
% the fading process. The channel block makes periodic measurements of the
% Doppler spectrum (blue stars). Over time with more samples processed by
% the block, the average of this measurement better approximates the
% theoretical Doppler spectrum (yellow curve).

% By opening the constellation diagram following the Rayleigh channel
% block, you can see the impact of wideband fading on the signal
% constellation. To slow down the channel dynamics for visualization
% purposes, we reduce the maximum Doppler shift to 5 Hz. Compared with the
% QPSK channel input signal, you can observe obvious distortion in the
% channel output signal, due to the ISI from the time dispersion of the
% wideband signal.

%% Narrowband or Frequency-Flat Fading
% When the bandwidth is too small for the signal to resolve the individual
% components, the frequency response is approximately flat because of the
% minimal time dispersion and very small ISI from the impulse response.
% This kind of multipath fading is often referred to as narrowband fading,
% or frequency-flat fading.
%%
% To observe the effect, we now reduce the signal bandwidth from 10M b/s
% (5M sym/s) to 1M b/s (500K sym/s), so the delay span (0.8 microseconds)
% of the channel is much smaller than the QPSK symbol period (2
% microseconds). Effectively, all delayed components combine at a single
% delay (in this case, at zero).
bitRate = 1e6  % 50 kb/s transmission

% We can visually validate this narrowband fading behavior by setting the
% |Channel visualization| parameter to 'Impulse and frequency responses'
% for the Rayleigh channel block and then running the model.

% For narrowband fading channels, a single-path fading model can accurately

%% Compare Path Gain Variation for Rician and Rayleigh Fading
% The Rician fading channel block models line-of-sight propagation in
% addition to diffuse multipath scattering. This results in a smaller
% variation in the magnitude of path gains. Compare the variation between
% Rayleigh and Rician channels by reconfiguring the channel blocks to model
% a single-path delay. Use a Time Scope block to view the fluctuation of
% the path gain magnitude over the duration of the simulation. There is
% less than 5dB variation of the path gain magnitude for the Rician fading
% channel and close to 15 dB for the Rayleigh fading channel. For the
% Rician fading channel, this variation would be further reduced by
% increasing the K-factor (currently set to 10).
